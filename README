The InteractiveTimeline extension is a MediaWiki Tag extension that allows
users to insert timelines into MediaWiki pages. The timelines are shown
using the CHAP Timeline javascript library developed by Almende, so they
may be panned and zoomed by the user, and events in the timeline may
contain images, links to other wiki pages or sites, and other formatting.

Full documentation may be found on the [extension page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:InteractiveTimeline)
